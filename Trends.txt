
Trend 1: Players are overwhelmingly male and typically in their early 20's.

Trend 2: While men dominate the player composition, female players seem to take the game rather seriously/competetively by spending more.

Trend 3: Super young players (<10 bin) spend frivilously with little concept as to the value of money, likely spending their parents' money at will.
	 Super old players (40+ bin) are the most conservative with their spending.
